    "As seen above there was only a difference of 19 students between the senior and freshman class. The freshman class is actually 1.25 times larger than the senior class, and no where near double it. This suprised me as I beleived there would be far more freshman who would be starting their computer science major, in comparison to seniors finishing degree requirements. While I did partially support my hypothesis in the fact that there are more freshman, the scale of this difference is not as large as I forsaw. "
